                The content on the Site is provided for general information and illustrative purposes only. It does not
                constitute:
            </p>

            <h2>3. Pilots, Contracts &amp; Service Terms</h2>
            <p>
                If you decide to run a pilot or deploy mixx in your organisation, that relationship will be governed
                by a separate
                agreement between you (or your organisation) and us. Such an agreement may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scope of services, deliverables and timelines.</li>
                <li>Data processing and confidentiality terms.</li>
                <li>Pricing, payment terms, and responsibilities.</li>
                <li>Specific service levels, warranties, and limitations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In case of conflict between these website Terms and a signed written agreement, the signed agreement
                will usually prevail for the subject matter it covers.
