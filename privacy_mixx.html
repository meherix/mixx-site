                Where EU/EEA data protection law applies (such as the GDPR), we rely on one or more of the following

                    contract or pilot agreement with you or your organisation.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> for example, to operate, improve and secure our services, to
                    communicate with you about relevant updates, and to develop new features, provided that these
                    interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> when required for certain communications or optional cookies/analytics.
                    You can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> when we must process data to comply with laws, regulations, or
                    lawful requests.</li>

                visits, pages viewed). Where required by law, we will show you a cookie or consent banner allowing you
                to accept or manage optional cookies.
            </p>
            <p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We store personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Policy, unless
                a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact and enquiry data is typically kept while we are in active discussions and for a reasonable
                    period afterwards.</li>
                <li>Pilot and service data is kept for the duration of the pilot or contract and for an additional
                    period where needed for reporting, backup, or legal obligations.</li>
                <li>Technical logs may be kept for shorter periods to ensure security and troubleshoot issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to store and process data within the EU/EEA where possible. If we use service providers or
                infrastructure located outside the EU/EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure an adequate level
                of data protection, for example by using standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards, where
                required by law.
